# Architecture Overview - VMware vSphere Reporter

## 1. Overview

The VMware vSphere Reporter is a comprehensive reporting tool designed to collect and present information from VMware vSphere environments. The application has evolved from a desktop-based tool (through versions v1-v24) to a web-based application (v29+). It provides detailed reports on various aspects of vSphere environments, including VMware Tools status, VM snapshots, and orphaned VMDK files. The tool is designed for system administrators to monitor and maintain their VMware infrastructure.

The application supports multiple platforms (Windows and Linux) and offers different report formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX) for flexibility in deployment and usage.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Evolution of Architecture

The system architecture has evolved significantly across versions:

1. **Early versions (v1-v24)**: Desktop-based application with:
   - PyQt5 GUI for Windows
   - Tkinter GUI for Linux
   - Command-line interface for headless operation

2. **Current version (v29+)**: Web-based application with:
   - Flask backend
   - Browser-based frontend
   - RESTful API for interaction between components

This architectural shift has improved accessibility, eliminated platform-specific issues, and simplified deployment.

### 2.2 Component Architecture

The current architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - Web interface built with Bootstrap
   - Interactive dashboard for displaying VMware infrastructure data

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Flask web framework
   - Report generation logic
   - Data collection modules

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - PyVmomi for VMware vSphere API integration
   - Report exporters (HTML, PDF, DOCX)

4. **Data Layer**:
   - In-memory data storage during runtime
   - File-based storage for generated reports

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 User Interface

#### Web Interface (v29+)
- Browser-based UI built with Bootstrap
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
- Dashboard for visualizing VMware infrastructure
- Interactive navigation with fixed positioning
- Login interface with support for demo mode

#### Desktop Interface (v1-v24)
- Windows: PyQt5-based GUI
- Linux: Tkinter-based GUI
- Command-line interface for automation

### 3.2 Core Modules

#### vSphere Client
- Handles connection to vCenter servers
- Manages authentication and session management
- Implements error handling for connectivity issues
- Provides abstraction layer over PyVmomi API

#### Data Collector
- Retrieves infrastructure data from vSphere
- Collects information on VMware Tools status
- Identifies VM snapshots and tracks their age
- Detects orphaned VMDK files
- Employs special error handling to ensure reliable data collection

#### Report Generator
- Processes collected data into structured formats
- Supports multiple export formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX)
- Implements templating system for consistent report appearance
- Handles formatting and styling of reports

### 3.3 Utility Components

#### Error Handling
- Custom exception classes for different error types
- Error filtering and suppression capabilities
- Debug mode for detailed diagnostic information
- Logging system for error tracking

#### Logging System
- Configurable logging levels
- Support for file and console output
- Detailed logs for debugging purposes
- Timestamp and categorization of log entries

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Authentication Flow

1. User provides vCenter credentials via web form
2. Application authenticates with vCenter server using PyVmomi
3. On successful authentication, session is established
4. Session information is stored for subsequent requests

### 4.2 Report Generation Flow

1. User selects report options through web interface
2. Application connects to vCenter and collects required data
3. Data is processed and formatted according to report type
4. Report is generated in selected format(s)
5. User can download the generated report(s)

### 4.3 Demo Mode Flow

1. User activates demo mode through interface
2. Application generates simulated vSphere environment data
3. Simulated data is processed identically to real data
4. Demo reports are generated for demonstration purposes

## 5. External Dependencies

### 5.1 Third-Party Libraries

#### Core Dependencies
- **pyVmomi**: VMware vSphere API Python SDK
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application (v29+)
- **PyQt5/Tkinter**: GUI frameworks for desktop versions
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine for report generation
- **reportlab**: PDF generation library
- **python-docx**: DOCX document generation

#### Additional Dependencies
- **humanize**: For human-readable data formatting
- **Flask-WTF**: Form handling and validation
- **pyecharts**: Chart generation (v29+)

### 5.2 External Systems

- **VMware vSphere Infrastructure**: Primary data source
- **vCenter Server**: Authentication and API endpoint
- **Web Browsers**: Client for web-based interface (v29+)

## 6. Deployment Strategy

### 6.1 Deployment Options

#### Windows Deployment
- Standalone executable via cx_Freeze
- MSI installer package for enterprise deployment
- Portable ZIP package for ad-hoc usage

#### Linux Deployment
- Package installation via setup script
- Virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Command-line deployment for server environments

### 6.2 Containerization

The web-based version (v29+) is designed with containerization in mind, supporting:
- Docker deployment
