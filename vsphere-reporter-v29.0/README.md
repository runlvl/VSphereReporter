## Usage

1. **Connect to vCenter**:
   - Click "Connect" in the navigation menu
   - Enter your vCenter server address, username, and password
   - Check "Ignore SSL certificate verification" if needed
   - Click "Connect"

2. **Configure Report Options**:
   - Select the sections you want to include in your report
   - All options are enabled by default

3. **Generate Reports**:
   - Choose your export format (HTML, PDF, DOCX)
   - Click "Generate Report"
   - Once the report is generated, you can download it

## Security Considerations

- Credentials are stored in memory only during the active session
- No persistent storage of vCenter credentials
- Sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity
- All connections to vCenter use the official VMware SDK (PyVmomi)

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your vCenter server is reachable and credentials are correct
- **Report Generation Errors**: Check the logs directory for detailed error messages
- **Missing Data**: Some report sections may be empty if the corresponding features are not used in your environment

## Advanced Configuration

The application supports several environment variables for advanced configuration:

- `PORT`: Change the default listening port (default: 5000)
- `VSPHERE_REPORTER_DEBUG`: Enable debug logging (set to "1" to enable)
- `VSPHERE_REPORTER_SECRET_KEY`: Custom secret key for session encryption

Example:
```
VSPHERE_REPORTER_DEBUG=1 PORT=8080 python app.py
```
